/*
        Classes: Blueprints for creating objects
        Objects: The instance(creation) of the class.

        Classes consist of two things:
                FIELDS - Conditions that the object will have.
                for example: A tv will have
                currentVolume
                CurrentChannel
                isOn
                and
                METHODS - are basically verbs or actions that change the conditions.
                For example: to change the tv conditions
                turnOff();
                turnOn();
                increaseVolume();
                decreaseVolume();
